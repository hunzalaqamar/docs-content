## System

### Resets

The ESP32-S3 has support for four levels of reset:
- **CPU:** resets CPU0/CPU1 core
- **Core:** resets the digital system, except for the RTC peripherals (ULP coprocessor, RTC memory).
- **System:** resets the entire digital system, including the RTC peripherals.
- **Chip:** resets the entire chip.

It is possible to conduct a software reset of this board, as well as obtaining the reset reason.

To do a hardware reset of the board, use the onboard reset button (PB1).

### Timers

The Nano ESP32 has the following timers:
- 52-bit system timer with 2x 52-bit counters (16 MHz) and 3x comparators.
- 4x general-purpose 54-bit timers
- 3x watchdog timers, two in main system (MWDT0/1), one in the RTC module (RWDT).

### Interrupts

All GPIOs on the Nano ESP32 can be configured to be used as interrupts, and is provided by an interrupt matrix. Interrupt pins are configured on an application level, using the following configurations:
- LOW
- HIGH
- CHANGE
- FALLING
- RISING

## Serial Communication Protocols

The ESP32-S3 chip provides flexibility for the various serial protocols it supports. For example, the I2C bus can be assigned to almost any available GPIO.

### Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)

Default pins:
- A4 - SDA
- A5 - SCL

The I2C bus is by default assigned to the A4/A5 (SDA/SCL) pins for retro compatibility. This pin assignment can however be changed, due to the flexibility of the ESP32-S3 chip.

The SDA and SCL pins can be assigned to most GPIOs, however some of these pins may have other essential functions that prevents I2C operations to run successfully.

**Please note:** many software libraries uses the standard pin assignment (A4/A5).

### Inter-IC Sound (I2S)

There two I2S controllers that are typically used for communication with audio devices. There are no specific pins assigned for I2S, this can be used by any free GPIO.

Using standard or TDM mode, the following lines are used:
- **MCLK** - master clock
- **BCLK** - bit clock
- **WS** - word select
- **DIN/DOUT** - serial data

Using PDM mode:
- **CLK** - PDM clock
- **DIN/DOUT** serial data

Read more about the I2S protocol in [Espressif's Peripheral API - InterIC Sounds (I2S)](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/api-reference/peripherals/i2s.html)

### Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)

- SCK - D13
- CIPO - D12
- COPI - D11
- CS - D10

The SPI controller is by default assigned to the pins above.

### Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)

- D0 / TX
- D1 / RX

The UART controller is by default assigned to the the pins above.

### Two Wire Automotive Interface (TWAI®)

The CAN/TWAI® controller is used to communicate with systems using the CAN/TWAI® protocol, particularly common in the automotive industry. There are no specific pins assigned for the CAN/TWAI® controller, any free GPIO can be used.

**Please note:** TWAI® is also known as the CAN2.0B, or "CAN classic". The CAN controller is **NOT** compatible with CAN FD frames.

## External Flash Memory

Nano ESP32 features a 128 Mbit (16 MB) external flash, the GD25B128EWIGR (U3). This memory is connected to the ESP32 via Quad Serial Peripheral Interface (QSPI).

The operating frequency for this IC is 133 MHz, and has a data transfer rate at up to 664 Mbit/s.

## USB Connector

The Nano ESP32 has one USB-C® port, used to power and program your board as well as sending & receiving serial communication.

Note that you should not power the board with more than 5 V via the USB-C® port.

## Power Options

Power can either be supplied via the VIN pin, or via USB-C® connector. Any voltage input either via USB or VIN is stepped down to 3.3 V using the MP2322GQH (U2) converter.

The operating voltage for this board is 3.3 V. Please note that there's no 5V pin available on this board, only the VBUS can provide 5 V when the board is powered via USB.

### Power Tree

![Arduino Nano ESP32 power tree.](assets/Nano_ESP32_Power_Tree.png)

### Pin Voltage

All digital & analog pins on the Nano ESP32 are 3.3 V. Do not connect any higher voltage devices to any of the pins as it will risk damaging the board.

### VIN Rating

The recommended input voltage range is **6-21 V**.

You should not attempt to power the board with a voltage outside the recommended range, particularly not higher than 21 V.

The efficiency of the converter depends on the input voltage via the VIN pin. See the average below for a board operation with normal current consumption:
- **4.5 V** - >90%.
- **12 V** - 85-90%
- **18 V** - <85%

This information is extracted from the MP2322GQH's datasheet.

### VBUS

There is no 5V pin available on the Nano ESP32. 5 V can only be provided via the **VBUS**, which is supplied directly from the USB-C® power source.

While powering the board via the VIN pin, the VBUS pin is not activated. This means you have no option of providing 5 V from the board unless powered via USB or externally.

### Using the 3.3 V Pin

The 3.3 V pin is connected to the 3.3 V rail which is connected to the output of the MP2322GQH step down converter. This pin is primarily used to power external components.

### Pin Current

The GPIOs on the Nano ESP32 can handle **source currents** up to **40 mA**, and **sink currents** up to **28 mA**. Never connect devices that draw higher current directly to a GPIO.
