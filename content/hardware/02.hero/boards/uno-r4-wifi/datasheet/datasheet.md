For more technical details on this microcontroller, visit the Renesas - RA4M1 series official documentation.

## Wi-Fi® / Bluetooth® Module (ESP32-S3-MINI-1-N8)

The Wi-Fi® / Bluetooth® LE module on the UNO R4 WiFi is from the ESP32-S3 SoCs. It features the Xtensa® dual-core 32-bit LX7 MCU, a built-in antenna and support for 2.4 GHz bands.

The ESP32-S3-MINI-1-N8 features:
* Wi-Fi® 4 - 2.4 GHz band
* Bluetooth® 5 LE support
* 3.3 V operating voltage
* 384  kB ROM
* 512  kB SRAM
* Up to 150 Mbps bit rate

This module acts as a secondary MCU on the UNO R4 WiFi, and communicates with the RA4M1 MCU using a logic-level translator. Note that this module operates on 3.3 V as opposed to the RA4M1's 5 V operating voltage.

### ESP Header

![ESP header.](assets/esp-header.png)

The header located close to the RESET button can be used to access the ESP32-S3 module directly. The pins accessible are:

* `ESP_IO42` - MTMS debugging (Pin 1)
* `ESP_IO41` - MTDI debugging (Pin 2)
* `ESP_TXD0` - Serial Transmit (UART) (Pin 3)
* `ESP_DOWNLOAD` - boot (Pin 4)
* `ESP_RXD0` - Serial Receive (UART) (Pin 5)
* `GND` - ground (Pin 6)

![ESP header (schematic)](assets/esp-header-2.png)

### USB Bridge

When programming the UNO R4 WiFi, the RA4M1 MCU is programmed via the ESP32-S3 module by default. The **U2** and **U6** switches can switch the USB communication to go directly to the RA4M1 MCU, by writing a high state to the `P408` pin (D40).

![](assets/usb_switch.png)

Soldering together the **SJ1** pads permanently sets the USB communication directly to the RA4M1, bypassing the ESP32-S3.

## USB Connector

The UNO R4 WiFi has one USB-C® port, used to power and program your board as well as sending & receiving serial communication.

**Note:** The board should not be powered with more than 5 V via the USB-C® port.

## LED Matrix

The UNO R4 WiFi features a 12x8 matrix of red LEDs (**U_LEDMATRIX**), connected using the technique known as charlieplexing.

The following pins on the RA4M1 MCU are used for the matrix:
- P003
- P004
- P011
- P012
- P013
- P015
- P204
- P205
- P206
- P212
- P213

![LED matrix schematics.](assets/matrix.png)

These LEDs can be accessed as an array, using a specific library. See the mapping below:

![LED matrix number mapping.](assets/matrix-2.png)

This matrix can be used for a number of projects and prototyping purposes, and supports animation, simple game designs and scrolling text among other things.

## Digital Analog Converter (DAC)

The UNO R4 WiFi has a DAC with up to 12-bit resolution attached to the A0 analog pin. A DAC is used to convert a digital signal to an analog signal.

The DAC can be used for signal generation for e.g. audio applications, like generating and altering sawtooth waves.

## I2C Connector

The I2C connector SM04B-SRSS-TB(LF)(SN) is connected to a secondary I2C bus on the board. Note that this connector is powered via 3.3 V.

![I2C connector.](assets/i2c-connector.png)

This connector also shares the following pin connections:

**JANALOG header**
- A4
- A5

**JDIGITAL header**
- SDA
- SCL

**Note:** as A4/A5 is connected to the main I2C bus, these should not be used as ADC inputs whenever the bus is in use. You can however connect I2C devices to each of these pins and connectors simultaneously.

## Power Options

Power can either be supplied via the VIN pin, or via USB-C® connector. If power is supplied via VIN, the ISL854102FRZ buck converter steps the voltage down to 5 V.

Both VUSB and VIN pins are connected to the ISL854102FRZ buck converter, with Schottky diodes in place for reverse polarity & overvoltage protection respectively.

Power via USB supplies about ~4.7 V (due to Schottky drop) to the RA4M1 MCU.

The linear regulator (SGM2205-3.3XKC3G/TR) converts 5 V from either the buck converter or USB, and provides 3.3 V to a number of components, including the ESP32-S3 module.

### Power Tree

![Arduino UNO R4 WiFi power tree.](assets/UNO_R4_WiFi_Power_Tree.png)

### Pin Voltage

The general operating voltage for UNO R4 WiFi is 5 V, however the ESP32-S3 module's operating voltage is 3.3 V.

**Note:** It is **very** important that ESP32-S3's pins (3.3 V) do not come in contact with any of the RA4M1's pins (5 V), as this may damage the circuits.

### Pin Current

The GPIOs on the R7FA4M1AB3CFM#AA0 microcontroller can safely handle up to 8 mA of current. Never connect devices that draw higher current directly to a GPIO as this may damage the circuit.

For powering e.g. servo motors, always use an external power supply.

To the best of our knowledge, we also declare that our products do not contain any of the substances listed on the "Authorization List" (Annex XIV of the REACH regulations) and Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in any significant amounts as specified by the Annex XVII of Candidate list published by ECHA (European Chemical Agency) 1907 /2006/EC.

## Conflict Minerals Declaration

As a global supplier of electronic and electrical components, Arduino is aware of our obligations with regards to laws and regulations regarding Conflict Minerals, specifically the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 1502. Arduino does not directly source or process conflict minerals such as Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten, or Gold. Conflict minerals are contained in our products in the form of solder, or as a component in metal alloys. As part of our reasonable due diligence Arduino has contacted component suppliers within our supply chain to verify their continued compliance with the regulations. Based on the information received thus far we declare that our products contain Conflict Minerals sourced from conflict-free areas.
